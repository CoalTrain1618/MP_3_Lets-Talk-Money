## Agile Methodology
### Overview
For this project, I plan to utilise the Agile methodology to promote flexibility and ensure steady progress towards a clear objective. Agile development is particularly effective in environments where requirements and ideas evolve throughout the development process. It enables teams to break down large tasks into manageable, iterative steps, fostering continuous improvement and adaptability. This approach allows for quick adjustments in response to changing needs, making it ideal for dynamic project environments.

### MoSCoW Prioritisation Technique
As part of the project planning process, I will apply the MoSCoW prioritisation technique to help determine the relative importance of features and tasks. This method categorises requirements into four distinct groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won’t Have (at this time). By clearly identifying what is essential versus what is optional or deferrable, this approach supports effective time and resource management, ensuring that critical elements are addressed early in the development cycle.

### GitHub Project Board
In line with Agile development methodology, I have made extensive use of GitHub’s project board by organising the development process into Epics, which are further broken down into user stories and manageable tasks. I have also utilised the Milestones feature, allowing me to group tasks into Sprint sections, each with a defined due date. By following this structured approach, I aim to maintain effective time management throughout the development of the web application, while also remaining adaptable to any necessary changes.

## Website Goals & Objectives
- Empower Users to Manage Personal Finances:
    - Provide tools to help users set monthly budgets and track expenses effectively.
    - Enable categorisation of expenses for better insight into spending habits.

- Promote Financial Awareness and Accountability:
    - Offer clear visual summaries of income, outgoings, and remaining budget.
    - Help users identify areas where they can reduce costs or improve saving.

- Ensure an Intuitive and Accessible Experience:
    - Design a user-friendly interface that is simple, responsive, and accessible on all devices.
    - Minimise friction when inputting data and navigating between budgeting tools.

- Support Ongoing Improvement and Scalability:
    - Follow Agile development practices to iterate based on user feedback.
    - Build a scalable infrastructure capable of handling user growth and feature expansion.

- Prioritise Data Security and User Privacy:
    - Implement secure authentication to protect personal financial information.
    - Comply with data protection standards to ensure users’ privacy and trust.

### User Stories
Through the implementation of Agile methodology, I created the user stories with the website’s goals and objectives in mind. The result is a well-organised structure of user stories, divided between developer-focused and visitor-focused perspectives. A full list of these is provided below.
