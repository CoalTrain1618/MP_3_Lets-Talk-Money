## Agile Methodology
### Overview
For this project, I plan to utilise the Agile methodology to promote flexibility and ensure steady progress towards a clear objective. Agile development is particularly effective in environments where requirements and ideas evolve throughout the development process. It enables teams to break down large tasks into manageable, iterative steps, fostering continuous improvement and adaptability. This approach allows for quick adjustments in response to changing needs, making it ideal for dynamic project environments.

### MoSCoW Prioritisation Technique
As part of the project planning process, I will apply the MoSCoW prioritisation technique to help determine the relative importance of features and tasks. This method categorises requirements into four distinct groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Wonâ€™t Have (at this time). By clearly identifying what is essential versus what is optional or deferrable, this approach supports effective time and resource management, ensuring that critical elements are addressed early in the development cycle.
